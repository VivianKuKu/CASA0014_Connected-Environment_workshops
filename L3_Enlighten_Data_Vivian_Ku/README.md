## EnLighten Data

### - Purpose
EnLighten Data is aiming to aware the data privacy issue and the presence of urban tech to all citizens. Just as the nutrition labels for food products, data collecting and usage policies should be notified to users in an easy-to-read way rather the long and tedious words. By doing so, smart city projects could be build upon the public trust, leading to a more successful project execution.

Particularly for the public wifi service, users tend to sign up for it without understanding their trade-offs, while others who care about their data privacy would backlash against other extended services even if these are out of good intentins.

EnLighten Data will work as a visualization interface when people access to public wifi service and show what kind of data will be taken by the tech company as well as arouse the awareness of the privacy concern.

My initial idea is coming from the InLink UK. InLink UK has popped up on London's streets since 2017. It provides free wifi, free call, and is equipped with environmental sensors for sound, light, and temperature. However, the privacy concern has never been subsided yet.

### - Concept
 
My idea is that when people access to the InLink UK kiosk, they will be detected by the ultrasonic sensor and Arduino will show the icons of the kinds of data collected by service. For the scenario below, there are MAC and the personal image will be captured by the system. In the meanwhile, Arduino will count the usage time when people are still in there, lighting more EYES every 10 mins which is quite scaring. (But for the prototyping, I use 2 seconds as an interval.)

Note: My inital idea is to visualize the number of real-time wifi users, yet it's hard to connect to the live data on this stage.
